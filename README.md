## Overview

Right now, the idea for the project is to make a program that helps tune guitars. On pressing a button on the Arduino, we use Python to record the strum of a guitar string. Once the recording stops, we take a [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) and use the Arduino to tell the user by how much to turn the tuning knob to get the string in tune.
